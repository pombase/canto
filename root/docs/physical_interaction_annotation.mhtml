<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating Physical Interactions -->
<!-- FLAGS: use_bootstrap -->

<p>
If you have physical interactions to curate, please read the
Directionality section carefully.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you only annotate interactions that you think are
biologically meaningful. For example, don't include known or suspected
contaminants from mass spectrometry results (e.g. ribosomal proteins,
translation factors, 'sticky' proteins).
</p>

<p>
When you choose 'Physical interaction', a popup appears with two
pulldown menus and a text field for optional comments.
</p>
<p>
Choose an evidence type from the first pulldown menu. Some
evidence types have a brief description that indicates the
directionality. Further information on evidence supporting physical
interactions, including examples of experiment types in each category, is available an the <a
href="http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/experimental_systems#genetic_interactions">BioGRID
help wiki</a> and in the Directionality section below.
</p>
<p>
Choose the interacting gene from the second pulldown menu. Click 'OK'
to finish the annotation and close the popup.
</p>
<p>
Note that only pairwise genetic interactions can be annotated in
Canto. 
</p>

<h3>Directionality</h3>
<p>
Some experiments that detect physical interactions
have an inherent directionality. For example, in a typical two-hybrid
experiment one protein (A) is fused to a DNA binding domain and a
second (B) is fused to a transcription activation domain. The
reciprocal experiment, with A fused to the activation domain and B
fused to the DNA binding domain, may or may not have been done.
</p>
<p>
For such "asymmetric" interactions, Canto allows you to curate in only
one direction starting from the gene you select first, as indicated
in the interaction type selector.
</p>
<p>
If the evidence description looks the wrong way around, you will have
to change genes and start again. (You can finish and then delete an
interaction annotation if you find that you have started with the
wrong gene.)

Use one of the Affinity Capture evidence types for
co-immunoprecipitation.

If you have done the experiment in both directions, you should curate
two annotations to describe the interaction completely. Curate
starting from one gene, then switch genes to annotate the reciprocal
experiment.

Other experiment types are "symmetric" and therefore only need to be
entered once, and you can start from either of the interacting genes.

*Note that PCA is not exactly symmetric, since there will be one
 N-terminal and one C-terminal reporter fusion construct, but it is
 treated as symmetric in Canto.
