<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating Protein Modifications -->

<p>
A protein modification is any covalent modification or other change that
alters the measured molecular mass of a peptide or protein amino acid residue.
</p>

<p>
Canto uses the <a href="http://www.psidev.info/MOD">PSI-MOD</a> ontology for
protein modification annotations. 
</p>

<p>
When you choose "Protein modification", you go to an ontology term search page
that works the same way as those for GO and phenotype terms: start typing a
term, and matching suggestions will appear.
</p>

<p>
You may find it helpful to search for a broad term (e.g. phosphorylated,
methylated, lysine), especially if you have trouble finding a specific term.
</p>

<p>
After you choose a term from the autocomplete list, you will go to a page that
shows the term definition and any more specific terms in the ontology. You can
thus refine your search iteratively before making your final selection
(examples of more specific terms are: O-phospho-L-serine, monomethylated
L-lysine). Also see the hints below, which should help you search for, and
recognize, the terms you need. Please read the definition carefully to ensure
that it fits your results accurately and completely.
</p>

<p>
When you have decided which term to use, click "Proceed" on the term page. On
the next page, select the applicable evidence from the pulldown, then
"Proceed" again. On the final page, you can add a comment; for example, if you
know which residues are modified, you can add a comment to indicate specific
positions (e.g. "phosphorylated on T123"). Note that at present, Canto can
only accept residue information in the annotation comment field or in the
"message to curators" box (which you see when you submit your curation
session).
</p>

<p>
Gene products may be annotated with multiple protein modification terms.

<h4>Hints for finding useful modification terms</h4>
<p>
Because PSI-MOD contains a number of very specific terms that may not be
familiar to all Canto users, PomBase curators have assembled a list of common
modifications and the best PSI-MOD terms to use for them.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phosphorylation:</strong> A search for "phosphorylated residue"
will find the broadest term (MOD:00696). You can use this term directly, but
the vast majority of phosphorylation fits the definition of "O-phosphorylated
residue" (MOD:01455). If you know which residue(s) is/are phosphorylated, you
can use one or more of the more specific terms. The most commonly applicable
are:
  <ul>
  <li>phosphorylated serine: O-phospho-L-serine (MOD:00046)</li>
  <li>phosphorylated threonine: O-phospho-L-threonine (MOD:00047)</li>
  <li>phosphorylated tyrosine: O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine (MOD:00048)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Methylation:</strong> PSI-MOD contains many terms decribing
methylation, for which the iterative search is particularly helpful. We
therefore suggest that you start by searching for the most general term,
"methylated residue" (MOD:00427). You can then work your way down to terms of
intermediate specificity, such as "N-methylated residue" (MOD:00602),
"methylated arginine" (MOD:00658), "methylated lysine" (MOD:00663), etc., and,
if applicable, very detailed terms such as "N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine"
(MOD:00083).</li>
<li><strong>Glycosylation:</strong> The broadest term is "glycosylated
residue" (MOD:00693). Although many very specific terms are available in
PSI-MOD, we anticipate that "glycosylated residue" or one of the child terms
shown on the MOD:00693 page (e.g. "N-glycosylated residue" (MOD:00006),
"O-glycosylated residue" (MOD:00396)) will suffice for most protein
modification annotation in Canto.</li>
</ul>
