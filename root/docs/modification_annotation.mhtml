<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating Protein Modifications -->
<!-- FLAGS: use_bootstrap -->


<p>
A protein modification is any covalent modification or other change that
alters the measured molecular mass of a peptide or protein amino acid residue.
</p>

<p>
Canto uses the <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/mod.html">PSI-MOD</a> ontology for
protein modification annotations. 
</p>

<p>
When you choose "Protein modification", you go to an ontology term search page
that works the same way as those for GO and phenotype terms: start typing a
term, and matching suggestions will appear.
</p>

<p>
You may find it helpful to search for a broad term (e.g. phosphorylated,
methylated, lysine), especially if you have trouble finding a specific term.
</p>

<p>
After you choose a term from the autocomplete list, you will go to a page that
shows the term definition and any more specific terms in the ontology. You can
thus refine your search iteratively before making your final selection
(examples of more specific terms are: O-phospho-L-serine, monomethylated
L-lysine). Also see the hints below, which should help you search for, and
recognize, the terms you need. Please read the definition carefully to ensure
that it fits your results accurately and completely.
</p>

<p>
When you have decided which term to use, click "Proceed" on the term
page. On the next page, select the applicable evidence from the
pulldown, then "Proceed" again. On the final page, you can add a
comment; for example, if you have any details that don't fit the
available annotation extensions, you can put them in the "message to
curators" box (which you see when you submit your curation session).
</p>

<p>
Gene products may be annotated with multiple protein modification terms.
</p>

<h4>Hints for finding useful modification terms</h4>
<p>
Because PSI-MOD contains a number of very specific terms that may not be
familiar to all Canto users, PomBase curators have assembled a list of common
modifications and the best PSI-MOD terms to use for them.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phosphorylation:</strong> A search for "phosphorylated residue"
will find the broadest term (MOD:00696). You can use this term directly, but
the vast majority of phosphorylation fits the definition of "O-phosphorylated
residue" (MOD:01455). If you know which residue(s) is/are phosphorylated, you
can use one or more of the more specific terms. The most commonly applicable
are:
  <ul>
  <li>phosphorylated serine: O-phospho-L-serine (MOD:00046)</li>
  <li>phosphorylated threonine: O-phospho-L-threonine (MOD:00047)</li>
  <li>phosphorylated tyrosine: O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine (MOD:00048)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Methylation:</strong> PSI-MOD contains many terms decribing
methylation, for which the iterative search is particularly helpful. We
therefore suggest that you start by searching for the most general term,
"methylated residue" (MOD:00427). You can then work your way down to terms of
intermediate specificity, such as "N-methylated residue" (MOD:00602),
"methylated arginine" (MOD:00658), "methylated lysine" (MOD:00663), etc., and,
if applicable, very detailed terms such as "N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine"
(MOD:00083).</li>
<li><strong>Glycosylation:</strong> The broadest term is "glycosylated
residue" (MOD:00693). Although many very specific terms are available in
PSI-MOD, we anticipate that "glycosylated residue" or one of the child terms
shown on the MOD:00693 page (e.g. "N-glycosylated residue" (MOD:00006),
"O-glycosylated residue" (MOD:00396)) will suffice for most protein
modification annotation in Canto.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Annotation extensions</h4>

<p>
You can add annotation extensions to provide additional specificity
for protein modification annotations. (See the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/documentation/gene-page-modifications">PomBase
documentation</a> for more information on annotation extensions.)
After you have selected an ontology term and evidence, the Canto
interface will display any available extension types. Click the link
to choose an extension type and bring up a pop-up in which you specify
the required details for the extension. For example, an annotation to
"O-phospho-L-threonine" can have any of these extensions:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/mod_ext_options.png') %>" alt="Modification annotation extension options"/>
</div>

<p>
Several annotation extension types are allowed for protein
modifications, falling into a few categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li> for "added by" or "removed by", choose a gene from the pulldown
 menu (you can enter new genes at this point if necessary)
</li>
<li> for "proportion of proteins with modification", enter a percent
 value (e.g. 55%) in the text box
</li>
<li> for "position(s) modified", enter one or more residue
 designations, using the single-letter amino acid code and a number
 for the position (e.g. S77)
  <ul>
    <li>Note: for histones, residue numbering assumes that the
    initiator methionine is removed. For example, histone H3 (hht1,
    hht2, hht3) is methylated on residues numbered K4 and K9, not K5
    and K10.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> for all other extension types, the ontology-search autocomplete
 box appears. Type text, choose from the suggestions, and drill down
 to more specific terms as usual
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In all cases, the actual relation name used by the database will
appear when you have finished the annotation plus extensions.
</p>

<p>
You can add one of each type, but if you add them at the same time
they will be interpreted as going together to form a compound
annotation in which all of the parts apply at once. To create
independent annotations (i.e. where one or another may apply, but not
necessarily all at once), finish the annotation with one extension (or
set of extensions), and then use the "Copy and edit" feature to create
another annotation where you can edit the extension(s).
</p>

<p>
When you edit or duplicate an annotation, extensions can also be
added, amended or deleted. An "Edit" button in the pop-up launches the
annotation extension addition steps.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/mod_ext_edit_button.png') %>" alt="button to edit annotation extensions"/>
</div>

<p>
To change an existing extension, first delete it and then add a new
one. Editing interface:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/edit_mod_ext.png') %>" alt="Annotation extension editing interface"/>
</div>


<p>
The "quick add" links available in advanced mode open the editing pop-up without any data entered or selected.
