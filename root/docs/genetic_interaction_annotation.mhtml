<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating Genetic Interactions -->
<!-- FLAGS: use_bootstrap -->

<p>
If you have genetic interactions to curate, please read the
Directionality section carefully.
</p>
<p>
When you choose 'Genetic interaction', a popup appears with two
pulldown menus and a text field for optional comments.
</p>
<p>
Choose an evidence type from the first pulldown menu. Some
evidence types have a brief description that indicates the
directionality. Further information on evidence supporting genetic
interactions is available an the <a
href="http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/experimental_systems#genetic_interactions">BioGRID
help wiki</a> and in the Directionality section below.
</p>
<p>
Choose the interacting gene from the second pulldown menu. Click 'OK'
to finish the annotation and close the popup.
</p>
<p>
Note that only pairwise genetic interactions can be annotated in
Canto. 
</p>

<h3>Directionality</h3>
<p>
Some genetic interactions have an inherent directionality. For
example, overexpression of one gene (A) may suppress the phenotype of
a mutation in a second gene (B), but overexpressing gene B may have no
effect on a mutant gene A phenotype.
</p>

<p>
For such "asymmetric" interactions, Canto allows you to curate in only
one direction starting from the gene you select first, as indicated in
the interaction type pulldown menu. If the evidence description looks
the wrong way around, you can finish and then edit the annotation, or
change genes and start again.
</p>

<p>
In Canto, genetic interactions follow BioGRID conventions, in which
the starting gene is known as "interactor A" or the "bait". The second
gene, which you choose in last pulldown, is called "interactor B", the
"hit", or the "prey".

<p>
If you have done the experiment in both directions, you should curate
two annotations to describe the interaction completely. Curate
starting from one gene, then switch genes to annotate the reciprocal
experiment.
</p>
<p>
Other interactions are "symmetric" and therefore only need to be
entered once, and you can start from either of the interacting
genes. Symmetric genetic interactions in Canto:
