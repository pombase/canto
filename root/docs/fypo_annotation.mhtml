<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
This document describes how to use the Canto phenotype curation
interface, and provides general and specific tips for choosing and
interpreting terms from the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO).
</p>

<p>
A phenotype is any observable characteristic or trait of an organism
that results from the interactions between its genotype and the
environment. For PomBase, Canto supports annotation of single- and
multiple-allele phenotypes using FYPO terms and additional useful
details such as evidence and experimental conditions.
</p>

<p>
When using FYPO terms -- or terms from any ontology -- always pay
careful attention to the term definitions. They are usually more
detailed, and often more informative, than the term names alone. For
each annotation, ensure that the definition of the selected term
accurately describes the experiment you are trying to capture, and
that the results shown in the paper fit all parts of the term
definition.

<h3><a name="single-allele-phenotypes">Single-allele phenotypes</a></h3>

<p>
A single allele is a mutation, or set of mutations, in one copy of a
gene at one locus (which may be the endogenous locus or a different
locus, such as a plasmid or an insertion at a non-native
position). You can also annotate under- or overexpression of the wild
type allele as a single "mutation". To annotate the phenotype of a
single allele, click "Single allele" in the list of curation types. A
box will pop up where you can add allele details:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_allele_small.png') %>" alt="add allele details"/>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Allele name</b>: this field is optional. Fill this in if the
    allele is named, e.g. "hsk1-89". For the "wild type" and
    "deletion" types, a default name will be assigned. For other
    types, the allele will be denoted "unnamed" if no name is filled
    in.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Allele name suggestions</b>: As you type the allele name, an
    autocomplete pulldown may appear if there are matches to any
    alleles already in Canto's database. If your allele name appears,
    you can select it, and its type and description will be filled
    in. You will only have to choose the expression level. Otherwise,
    proceed to add allele details:
  </li>
  <li>
    Synonyms: Any synonyms for the allele already in the database will
    be listed as "Existing synonyms". You can add more in the "New
    synonyms" box; use commas to separate multiple entries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Allele type</b>: choose an allele type in the dropdown
    menu. For some types, e.g. partial deletions or substitution,
    further specifications are needed, and in these cases an "Allele
    description" box appears, with an example displayed below the box
    in grey text. To specify positions:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Number amino acid residues starting at the initiator
	methionine for all proteins <b>except</b> histones. For
	histones, residue numbering assumes that the initiator
	methionine is removed.
      </li>
      <li>
	For insertions, enter the number of the residue before the
	insertion, a hyphen, and the inserted sequence.
      </li>
      <li>
	For combinations of substitutions, insertions, and/or
	deletions, separate parts of the description with commas. For
	example, "858-MKGYP,F124D" means five amino acid residues were
	inserted after position 858, and Asp was changed to Phe at
	position 124.
      </li>
      <li>
	For protein-coding genes, number nucleotide positions starting
	with the "A" of the initiator ATG, and exclude introns. (See
	below for how to describe changes in intron sequences.)
	Mutations in promoter regions can be specified by prefixing
	the numbers with a minus sign ("-").
      </li>
      <li> 
	For non-coding RNA genes, number nucleotide positions starting
	from the annotated 5' end of the mature transcript, i.e. again
	exclude introns. See below for how to describe changes in
	intron sequences.
      </li>
      <li>
	For changes in intron sequences, count nucleotide residues
	from the starting point as described above, enter the
	resulting position number(s), and include the suffix
	"primary_transcript" (e.g. G234A-primary_transcript for a
	substitution, 456-555-primary_transcript for a deletion, or
	188-TTCC-primary_transcript for an insertion).
      </li>
    </ul>
    If the specific mutations are not known choose "unknown". If none
    of the available allele types fits, choose "other" and describe
    the changes in free text.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Expression level</b>: You will be prompted to define the
    expression level relative to wild-type (deletion mutants are
    automatically set to null). Note that "expression" refers to the
    amount of gene product present in the assayed cells. If the
    product level was not measured (e.g. by Western blot for a
    protein), choose "Not assayed", even if a construct such as an
    inducible promoter was used to try to alter expression. If a
    wild-type allele was investigated in the absence of any other
    changes, then we strongly recommend setting an altered expression
    level.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Descriptions for "unknown" alleles</b>: If you know the
    description for any allele that is listed as "unknown" in Canto,
    please enter it. To do so, type in the allele name, but <b>do
    not</b> select it from the autocomplete options. Instead, proceed
    as if no match had been found, and you will be able to choose a
    type and enter a description.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Next, to find a FYPO term, type text into the search box. When
suggestions from the autocomplete feature appear, choose one and
proceed.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_search.png') %>" alt="FYPO term search"/>
</div>

<p>
If your initial search does not find any suitable terms, try again
with a broader term (some examples are provided in the specific
sections below). Selecting a term takes you to a page where you can
read the definition to confirm that it is applicable. More specific
"child" terms will be shown (where available), and you can select one
of these more specific terms in an iterative process.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_def.png') %>" alt="FYPO term details with definition"/>
</div>

<p>
FYPO terms are organised in a hierarchical structure, and FYPO
annotations should be as specific as possible to describe the data
from your experiment. (More information on <a
href="https://curation.pombase.org/pombase-trac/wiki/FYPOContentStructure">FYPO
organisation</a> is available on the PomBase wiki.) You will have the
opportunity to request a new term if the most specific term available
does not describe your gene product adequately.
</p>

<p>
After you choose a term, you will then be prompted to select evidence
from a pulldown menu, and then to enter any (optional) experimental
conditions. For conditions, type text and select from the autocomplete
options. Several conditions can be added for one experiment. Condition
terms previously used in the session appear below the text box and can
be re-used by clicking on them.
</p>

    <p>Conditions are aspects of the experimental setup that may be
    relevant to various different methods, and are independent of what
    cells, strain, organism, etc. are used. Examples include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Glucose minimal medium vs. glucose rich medium (synonyms for some
        standard media are available, such as EMM or YES; carbon
        sources other than glucose can be specified).
      </li>
      <li>
        Agar plates vs. liquid medium
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition of certain chemicals; for instance, in a salt stress
        experiment it may be of interest to note what salts were added.
      </li>
      <li>Temperature (high, standard or low).</li>
      <li>
        Exclusion of some chemicals that one might normally expect to be
        present.
      </li>
    </ul>

<p>
Note: you can also enter a single allele as a genotype using the
genotype management interface, which is described below for
multi-allele phenotypes. This is because the Chado database that Canto
uses links all phenotypes to a genotype, whether that genotype
specifies one or more alleles.
</p>


<h3><a name="multi-allele-phenotypes">Multiple-allele genotypes and diploids</a></h3>

</p>
The "Genotype management" link on the paper summary page or any gene
page goes to the Genotypes page, which displays genes and genotypes
added for the paper. On this page you can create single- or
multi-allele genotypes, and create genotypes for diploids as well as
haploids.
<p>

<p>
Use the multi-allele genotype option to annotate phenotypes of a
double mutant, triple mutant, or any strain in which more than one
gene has its sequence or expression altered, including any case where
you have more than one allele of the same gene present (e.g. one on
the chromosome, and another on a plasmid). Enter details of all
relevant alleles in the genotype (background details such as mating
type and markers are optional).
</p>

<p>
On the left-hand side of the page is a table of genes. For each gene,
you can use the "Deletion" button to add a deletion as a single-allele
genotype with one click, or click "Other genotype" to bring up the
allele details popup (described above).
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/genotype_genes.png') %>" alt="genotype page gene table"/>
</div>

<p>
As you add alleles, they will appear in a table on the right (any
single alleles added via the "single allele phenotype" gene page
option will also appear):
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/one_genotype_table.png') %>" alt="single-locus genotype table"/>
</div>

<p>
To create a diploid genotype, select one allele in the single-locus
genotype table. The "Create diploid locus" button becomes enabled:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/diploid_button.png') %>" alt="single-locus genotype table with one selection"/>
</div>

<p>
A pop-up appears, with options to create a diploid homozygous for the
selected allele, or a heterozygous diploid with the wild type
allele. If more than one allele has been entered for the gene, a
heterozygous genotype will appear for each additional allele:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/diploid_options.png') %>" alt="popup to select homozygous or heterozygous diploid"/>
</div>

<p>
To create a multi-allele genotype, first add all of the constituent
single alleles to the single-locus genotype table. Then select two or more
alleles by ticking the boxes at the left side of the table. The
"Combine selected genotypes" button becomes enabled:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/single_allele_table_selections.png') %>" alt="single-locus genotype table with two selections"/>
</div>

<p>
Click the button to add the new genotype to the table of multi-allele
genotypes:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/genotype_tables.png') %>" alt="single- and multi-locus genotype tables"/>
</div>

<p>
For multi-locus diploid genotypes, create single-locus diploid
genotypes, which you can then select and combine.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Using wild-type alleles in genotypes:</strong> A wild type
gene at its normal (endogenous) expression level should not have
phenotypes annotated in Canto. Single wild-type alleles should only
have phenotypes if the gene is expressed at a higher (overexpression)
or lower (knockdown) level than normal. Similarly, in a multi-allele
genotype, the wild-type allele is the only allele of the gene present,
it should only be included if it is over- or underexpressed. Although
it is possible to add a wild type as a single allele with wild type
expression, this is intended only for use in cases where both
wild-type and mutant alleles of the same gene are present (usually
done to test whether the mutation is dominant over wild type). In
these multi-allele genotypes the wild-type allele can have wild type
expression specified.
</p>


<h3>Using, editing, deleting and duplicating genotypes</h3>

<p>
<strong>Mouseover options:</strong> When you mouse over any genotype
in either table, a set of options appears in a popup:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/genotype_options.png') %>" alt=""/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Add/edit background:</strong> This link pops up a text box
where you can enter background alleles (we plan to add more
sophisticated allele lookup later). If any background details are
included, they appear in a column in the genotype table:
</p>

<p>
Note:If a single allele has a background, the background will be
included with any multi-allele genotype that uses the allele. If two
or more alleles have backgrounds, the backgrounds will be combined in
the multi-allele genotype (duplicate alleles will only be included
once). To change the background, use the one of the "Add/edit
background", "Edit details", or "Copy and edit" options.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Start a phenotype annotation:</strong> The phenotype
annotation procedure is identical to the single-allele curation
interface -- find a suitable FYPO term, enter evidence and conditions,
and finish the annotation all as described above. You can return to
the Genotypes page at any time to select a genotype and add a
phenotype for it, or to add or edit genotypes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>View annotations:</strong> This links to a page that lists the
genotype details, a table of phenotypes annotated for the genotype,
and an additional link to the phenotype annotation interface.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Edit details:</strong> On the genotype editing page, you can
edit the details (name, description, expression) of alleles in the
genotype, remove alleles, or add text describing the background. You
can also add alleles using the gene table on the left, but this will
usually be slower than combining single alleles on the genotype
management page. Note that changes will apply to any phenotypes
already annotated to the genotype.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Copy and edit:</strong> This links to the genotype editing
page as described above, but creates a new genotype with the amended
details (and no annotations).
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/genotype_background.png') %>" alt=""/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Delete:</strong> The "Delete" link will ask you to confirm
that you want to remove a genotype, and then delete it. The link is
disabled for any genotype that has phenotype annotations. To delete a
genotype with annotations, first delete the annotations (use the "view
annotations" link or return to the paper summary page).
</p>

<h3>Editing, deleting and duplicating phenotypes</h3>

<p>
<strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to make changes to an annotation
you have made, use the "Edit" link next to the annotation in the
table. In the pop-up edit the appropriate fields, then click "OK".
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_edit.png') %>" alt="phenotype editing interface"/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Delete:</strong> The "Delete" link will ask you to confirm
that you want to remove an annotation, and then delete it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Copy and edit:</strong> The "Copy and edit" link allows you to
make a new annotation to the same allele or genotype, or transfer the
annotation any other genotype in the genotype list (with or without
changing any other details). For example, you may want to indicate
that you have observed a phenotype under more than one set of
conditions, e.g. at both standard and high temperatures. The interface
works the same way as for editing an annotation, except that a new
annotation is created, and the old annotation is retained without
changes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Quick Add:</strong> The "quick add" links available in
advanced mode open the editing pop-up without any data entered or
selected. Note that you cannot create alleles or genotypes in the
"quick" phenotype interface; it uses genotypes that have already been
entered in the Canto session.
</p>

<h3>Annotation extensions</h3>

<p>
You can add annotation extensions to provide additional specificity
for FYPO annotations. (See the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes">PomBase
documentation</a> for more information on annotation extensions.)
After you have selected an ontology term and evidence, the Canto
interface will display any available extension types. Click the link
to choose an extension type and bring up a pop-up in which you specify
the required details for the extension. For example, an annotation to
"protein mislocalized to nucleus" can have any of these extensions:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_ext_options.png') %>" alt="FYPO annotation extension options"/>
</div>

<p>
If more than one type is offered, you can add one of each type, but if
you add them at the same time they will be interpreted as going
together to form a compound annotation in which all of the parts apply
at once. To create independent annotations (i.e. where one or another
may apply, but not necessarily all at once), finish the annotation
with one extension (or set of extensions), and then use the
"Copy and edit" feature to create another annotation where you can edit
the extension(s).
</p>

<p>
In all cases, the actual relation name used by the database will
appear when you have finished the annotation plus extensions.
</p>

<p>
When you edit or duplicate an annotation, extensions can also be
added, amended or deleted. An "Edit" button in the pop-up launches the
annotation extension addition steps.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_ext_edit_button.png') %>" alt="button to edit annotation extensions"/>
</div>

<p>
To change an existing extension, first delete it and then add a new
one. Editing interface ("protein mislocalized to nucleus" example):
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/edit_fypo_ext.png') %>" alt="Annotation extension editing interface"/>
</div>


<p>
Phenotype annotation extensions can be used to indicate:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
 Penetrance: the proportion of a population that shows the
 phenotype. The penetrance measurement can be qualitative or
 quantitative. The pulldown menu for qualitative options is selected
 by default. For a quantitative value, switch the radio button and
 enter a percentage (e.g. 38%) in the text box.
</li>
<li>
 Severity: Only qualitative values are supported; choose from the
 pulldown menu. (Note: severity was previously called "expressivity",
 and can still be used in the sense of the extent to which a phenotype
 is expressed.)
</li>
<li>
 A specific gene, RNA or protein, used in an assay (see "Targets of
 mutated genes" and "Localization phenotypes" below). The pulldown
 menu is populated with genes from the list you entered for the
 paper. You can add another gene at this point if necessary. For some
 phenotypes, a Sequence Ontology (SO) term can be selected to describe
 a more general sequence region or class of transcripts. In these
 cases, the ontology-search autocomplete box appears, and searches
 SO. Type text, choose from the suggestions, and drill down to more
 specific terms as usual.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
More details on annotation extension options are available in the
"phenotype tips" sections below.
</p>

<h2><a name="gentips">General phenotype tips</a></h2>

<h3>Phenotype vs. GO annotations</h3>
<p>
  GO annotations should always reflect a gene's direct involvement in,
  or role in regulating, processes or functions. In contrast,
  phenotype annotations indicate that a mutation causes a change in a
  process, but may reflect downstream or indirect effects.
</p>
<p>
  For example, cells mutated for a gene involved in cell wall
  biosynthesis may display defects in cytokinesis. This gene should
  not be annotated to the GO process term "cytokinesis" because its
  effect on cytokinesis is an indirect effect of improper cell wall
  biosynthesis, but the mutant allele may be annotated to the FYPO
  term "abnormal cytokinesis".
</p>
<p>
  Most commonly, more phenotypes than GO terms can be extracted from a
  paper. Sometimes, several phenotype annotations but no GO
  annotations can be made, because the experiments do not definitively
  resolve the exact process that the gene is involved in.
</p>


<h3>Phenotype categories</h3>
<p>
Phenotypes may be observed at the level of a cell or its parts
(e.g. "elongated cell", "abnormal cytokinesis", "abnormal microtubule
cytoskeleton morphology"), or at a population level
(e.g. "flocculating cells"). In particular, note that viability can be
described at either the cell or population level, or both (also see
below). Phenotypes affecting binding or enzymatic activities, such as
cases where a mutation decreases enzymatic activity, can also be
annotated. Phenotypes affecting molecular functions will be displayed
with the "cell phenotypes" on PomBase gene pages (even if the activity
was assayed in vitro).

</p>

<h3>Normal phenotypes</h3>
<p>
Often, a mutant will be assayed for a phenotype but will appear
identical to wild-type cells in the assay. One or more of the "normal
phenotype" terms, which are defined as having no observable difference
from wild type under the given conditions, can be used to annotate
these mutants. For example, an allele may be annotated to "normal
growth on amphotericin B" or "normal cell morphology". A mutant may be
"normal" in one respect, but abnormal in another (for instance, cells
may grow at a normal rate, but have an abnormal morphology). Note that
it is not necessary to annotate all respects in which a mutant cell is
normal, only those that are unexpected or otherwise interesting.
</p>

<h3>Targets of mutated genes</h3>
<p>
For any phenotype where an effect on the amount, stability,
localization, etc. of a specific gene or gene product (protein or RNA)
was measured, an extension should be included to identify the genes,
RNAs, or proteins used in the experiment. The reasons are that the
measured product may be that of a gene that was not mutated, and that
the mutation may affect different gene products differently. For
example, deletion of gene A may result in an increased amount of RNA
transcribed from gene B; or a point mutation in A may cause decreased
phosphorylation of protein B but not protein C. In these cases the
annotation should be made to gene A, and an extension should be
included that gene B is affected (and that C is not affected, in the
second example). Sometimes it may be necessary to specify two
targets. For instance, if a mutation in gene A cause "decreased
binding" between protein B and protein C, include both B and C in the
comment.
</p>

<h3>Localization phenotypes</h3>
<p>
If the localization of a protein or RNA is altered in a mutant
compared to wild type, this should be annotated as a phenotype of the
mutated gene (which may be different from the gene encoding the
mislocalized product). Include an extension to identify the
mislocalized protein/RNA, as described above. For example, if deletion
of gene A causes gene B to localize to the cytoplasm instead of the
nucleus, annotate A to an "abnormal protein localization" term (such
as "abolished protein localization to nucleus, with protein
mislocalized to cytoplasm"), and mention B in an extension.
</p>

<h3>Phenotypes of wild-type cells</h3>
<p>
Please note that only <b>mutant</b> phenotypes should be annotated in
Canto -- i.e., the characteristics of cells in which DNA sequence of a
gene is altered, or when its expression level is changed (or
both). Any changes occurring in wild-type cells in response to a
stimulus (such as an effect resulting from the inhibition of a
wild-type gene when it binds a substance) can therefore not be
captured as a phenotype. Please include information of this sort in a
comment, and PomBase curators will advise you how to proceed (for
example, it may be possible to use a GO annotation with an extension).
</p>


<h2><a name="sptips">Specific phenotype tips</a></h2>

<h3>Cell and population viability</h3>

<p>
To capture whether a mutant is viable or inviable overall, use one of
the cell population viability terms. As noted in the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/faqs/can-i-get-list-essential-pombe-genes">PomBase
FAQ on essential genes</a>, the most commonly used terms are "viable
vegetative cell population" (FYPO:0002060) and "inviable vegetative
cell population" (FYPO:0002061).
</p>
<p>
To describe characteristics of viable or inviable cells, FYPO has a
wide selection of "viable cell" and "inviable cell" terms that also
specify other features such as shape, presence and number of nuclei or
septa, etc. If one mutation gives rise to a mixed population, more
than one term may be used for the same allele, including both "viable"
and "inviable" terms, and extensions should be used to indicate
penetrance. See the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/faqs/why-are-some-genes-annotated-both-viable-and-inviable-phenotypes">relevant
FAQ</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Cell growth vs. cell population growth</h3>
<p>
Most experiments that measure "growth" observe a population of
cells, such as a culture in liquid medium or a colony on a
plate. For these experiments, use one or more of the "cell
population growth" terms. In contrast, terms such as "normal cell
growth" refer specifically to growth in the sense of an increase
in cell size. Also see "Slow growth, decreased cell density and
decreased growth" below.
</p>

<h3>Slow growth, decreased cell density and decreased growth</h3>
<p>
"Slow cell population growth" refers specifically to when the rate
of growth (slope) of a cell population is decreased. "Decreased
cell density in stationary phase" refers to when a population
reaches stationary phase at, and maintains, a lower cell density
than wild type (the rate of growth may still be the same as
wild-type). An allele may be annotated to both terms. If you do
not know which of these is decreased (typically if cells are grown
on agar plates for a number of days and then observed) use
"decreased cell population growth".
</p>

<h3>Cellular structures vs. processes affecting cellular structures</h3>
<p>
FYPO includes many pairs of terms that refer to the same cellular or
subcellular structure, where one describes the structure (as normal,
abnormal, etc.) and the other describes a process affecting the
structure. In each pair, the structural phenotype term uses a GO
cellular component (CC) term in its logical definition, and the
process phenotype term uses a GO biological process (BP) term. The
terms will often be linked by a has_output relation. For example,
"abnormal kinetochore morphology" (FYPO:0000050) refers to the GO CC
term "kinetochore" (GO:0000776), and "abnormal kinetochore
organization" (FYPO:0000807) refers to the GO BP term "kinetochore
organization" (GO:0051383).
</p>

<p>
Use the process phenotype term to annotate experiments in which the
assay can monitor the process as it occurs (e.g. if you have movies,
kymographs, a reconstituted system, or even a sufficiently detailed
series of still pictures). Otherwise, use the structure or morphology
phenotype terms (e.g. when you have only one or a few still pictures).
</p>

<h3>Translation vs. protein level</h3>
<p>
  Typically, assays such as western blots do not distinguish between
  increased translation or decreased degradation. If these cannot be
  distinguished between then the correct terms to use are increased,
  decreased, or normal protein level. If the assay is specific enough,
  then the translation or degradation terms may be used
  (e.g. "decreased translation" or "increased protein
  degradation"). In either case, the specific protein(s) assayed can
  be put in annotation extensions.
</p>

<h3>Transcription vs. RNA level</h3>
<p>
  Typically, assays such as northern blots do not distinguish between
  increased transcription or decreased degradation. If these cannot be
  distinguished between then the correct terms to use are increased,
  decreased, or normal RNA level. If the assay is specific enough,
  then the transcription or degradation terms may be used (e.g. a
  run-on assay can support annotation to "decreased
  transcription"). In either case, the specific gene(s) assayed can be
  put in annotation extensions.

<h3>Septation</h3>
<p>
  Usually, "abnormal septum assembly" (FYPO:0000117), "normal septum
  assembly" (FYPO:0000673), or one of the more specific "septum
  assembly" terms will apply. Also consider annotating to a
  "actomyosin contractile ring contraction" term (abnormal,
  FYPO:0001364; normal, FYPO:0004097; or a more specific term) in
  cases where "septation" is used to refer to the coordinated
  processes of ring contraction and septum formation.
