<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
This document describes how to use the Canto phenotype curation
interface, and provides general and specific tips for choosing and
interpreting terms from the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO).
</p>

<p>
A phenotype is any observable characteristic or trait of an organism
that results from the interactions between its genotype and the
environment. For PomBase, Canto supports annotation of single- and
multiple-allele phenotypes using FYPO terms and additional useful
details such as evidence and experimental conditions.
</p>

<p>
When using FYPO terms -- or terms from any ontology -- always pay
careful attention to the term definitions. They are usually more
detailed, and often more informative, than the term names alone. For
each annotation, ensure that the definition of the selected term
accurately describes the experiment you are trying to capture, and
that the results shown in the paper fit all parts of the term
definition.

<h3><a name="single-allele-phenotypes">Single-allele phenotypes</a></h3>
<p>
A single allele is a mutation, or set of mutations, in one copy of a
gene at one locus (which may be the endogenous locus or a different
locus, such as a plasmid or an insertion at a non-native
position). You can also annotate under- or overexpression of the wild
type allele as a single "mutation". To annotate the phenotype of a
single allele, click "Single allele" in the list of curation types. A
box will pop up where you can add allele details:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_allele_small.png') %>" alt="add allele details"/>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Allele name</b>: this field is optional. Fill this in if the
    allele is named, e.g. "cdc25-22". For the "wild type" and
    "deletion" types, a default name will be assigned. For other
    types, the allele will be denoted "unnamed" if no name is filled
    in.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Allele type</b>: choose an allele type in the dropdown
    menu. For some types, e.g. partial deletions or substitution,
    further specifications are needed, and in these cases an example
    will be displayed in the box in grey text. Number nucleotide
    positions starting with the "A" of the initiator ATG for
    protein-coding genes. (Note that mutations in promoter regions can
    also be specified by prefixing the numbers with a minus "-" sign.)
    If the specific mutations are not known choose "unknown". If the
    alterations are complex (for instance, a mixture of insertions,
    point mutations, etc.), choose "other" and describe the changes in
    free text.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Expression level</b>: You will be prompted to define the
    expression level relative to wild-type (deletion mutants are
    automatically set to null). Note that "expression" refers to the
    amount of gene product present in the assayed cells. If the
    product level was not measured (e.g. by Western blot for a
    protein), choose "Not assayed", even if a construct such as an
    inducible promoter was used to try to alter expression. If a
    wild-type allele was investigated in the absence of any other
    changes, then an altered expression level must be set.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Next, to find a FYPO term, type text into the search box. When
suggestions from the autocomplete feature appear, choose one and
proceed.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_search.png') %>" alt="FYPO term search"/>
</div>

<p>
If your initial search does not find any suitable terms, try again
with a broader term (some examples are provided in the specific
sections below). Selecting a term takes you to a page where you can
read the definition to confirm that it is applicable. More specific
"child" terms will be shown (where available), and you can select one
of these more specific terms in an iterative process.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_def.png') %>" alt="FYPO term details with definition"/>
</div>

<p>
FYPO terms are organised in a hierarchical structure, and FYPO
annotations should be as specific as possible to describe the data
from your experiment. (More information on <a
href="http://curation.pombase.org/pombase-trac/wiki/FYPOContentStructure">FYPO
organisation</a> is available on the PomBase wiki.) You will have the
opportunity to request a new term if the most specific term available
does not describe your gene product adequately.
</p>

<p>
After you choose a term, you will then be prompted to select evidence
from a pulldown menu, and then to enter any (optional) experimental
conditions. For conditions, type text and select from the autocomplete
options. Several conditions can be added for one experiment. Condition
terms previously used in the session appear below the text box and can
be re-used by clicking on them.
</p>

    <p>Conditions are aspects of the experimental setup that may be
    relevant to various different methods, and are independent of what
    cells, strain, organism, etc. are used. Examples include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Glucose minimal medium vs. glucose rich medium (synonyms for some
        standard media are available, such as EMM or YES; carbon
        sources other than glucose can be specified).
      </li>
      <li>
        Agar plates vs. liquid medium
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition of certain chemicals; for instance, in a salt stress
        experiment it may be of interest to note what salts were added.
      </li>
      <li>Temperature (high, standard or low).</li>
      <li>
        Exclusion of some chemicals that one might normally expect to be
        present.
      </li>
    </ul>


<p>
Note: you can also enter a single allele as a genotype using the
genotype management interface, which is described below for
multi-allele phenotypes. This is because the Chado database that Canto
uses links all phenotypes to a genotype, whether that genotype
specifies one or more alleles.
</p>


<h3><a name="multi-allele-phenotypes">Multiple-allele phenotypes and genotypes</a></h3>

<p>
Use the multi-allele phenotype option to annotate of a double mutant,
triple mutant, or any strain in which more than one gene has its
sequence or expression altered, including any case where you have more
than one allele of the same gene present (e.g. one on the chromosome,
and another on a plasmid). To do so, you must enter details of all
relevant alleles in the genotype (background details such as mating
type and markers are optional). There are two routes to do this:
select the "Multiple allele" phenotype option in the curation types
list on a gene-specific page, or follow the "Genotype management" link
on the paper summary page. Either link takes you to the Genotypes
page, which displays genotypes added or selected for the paper on the
right-hand side of the page. On the left you can search for a genotype
in the Canto database or enter a new genotype.
</p>

<p>
To search, click "Find an existing genotype...", then select the
relevant genes from the list. Any matches will appear on the right,
and you can click the link to use one.
</p>

<p>
If the genotype you need isn't available, go back to the Genotypes
page, and click "Add a genotype..." The allele curation interface is
the same as for single alleles, as described above. Simply add one or
more allele(s) for each gene using the "Add allele..." button, and
click "Finish" when you have finished entering all genotype
details.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/add_genotype.png') %>" alt="adding a genotype"/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Using wild-type alleles in genotypes:</strong> For
single-allele phenotypes, the wild-type allele must be expressed at a
higher (overexpression) or lower (knockdown) level than normal to
create a genotype and use it for FYPO annotations; wild type at its
normal (endogenous) expression level should not have phenotypes
annotated in Canto. Similarly, in a multi-allele genotype, the
wild-type allele of any gene must be over- or underexpressed if it is
the only allele of the gene present. If both wild-type and mutant
alleles of the same gene are present (usually done to test whether the
mutation is dominant over wild type), the wild-type allele can have
endogenous expression specified. In the genotype addition interface,
select the gene and enter details for the mutant allele first. You can
then select the same gene, choose "wild type", and "endogenous" will
be offered as one of the expression level options.
</p>

<p>
You can edit or delete a genotype that you have entered for the paper
you are curating (but you cannot change an existing genotype that you
have found and used). Thereafter, the rest of the phenotype annotation
procedure is identical to the single-allele curation interface -- find
a suitable FYPO term, enter evidence and conditions, and finish the
annotation all as described above. You can return to the Genotypes
page at any time to select a genotype and add a phenotype for it, or
to find, add or edit genotypes.
</p>

<h3>Editing, deleting and duplicating phenotypes</h3>

<p>
<strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to make changes to an annotation
you have made, use the "Edit" link next to the annotation in the
table. In the pop-up edit the appropriate fields, then click "OK".
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_edit.png') %>" alt="phenotype editing interface"/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Delete:</strong> The "Delete" link will ask you to confirm
that you want to remove an annotation, and then delete it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Copy and edit:</strong> The "Copy and edit" link in the table on the
gene page allows you to make a new annotation to the same allele or
genotype. For example, you may want to indicate that you have observed
a phenotype under more than one set of conditions, e.g. at both
standard and high temperatures. The interface works the same way as
for editing an annotation, except that a new annotation is created,
and the old annotation is retained without changes.
</p>

<p>
On the paper summary page, the "Copy and edit" link adds one more feature:
the annotation can be transferred, with or without other changes, to
any other genotype in the genotype list, by changing the top pulldown:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_dup_summary.png') %>" alt="phenotype duplication on summary page"/>
</div>

<h3>Annotation extensions</h3>

<p>
You can add annotation extensions to provide additional specificity
for FYPO annotations. (See the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/documentation/gene-page-phenotypes">PomBase
documentation</a> for more information on annotation extensions.)
After you have selected an ontology term and evidence, the Canto
interface will display any available extension types. Click the link
to choose an extension type and bring up a pop-up in which you specify
the required details for the extension. For example, an annotation to
"protein mislocalized to nucleus" can have any of these extensions:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/fypo_ext_options.png') %>" alt="FYPO annotation extension options"/>
</div>

<p>
If more than one type is offered, you can add one of each type, but if
you add them at the same time they will be interpreted as going
together to form a compound annotation in which all of the parts apply
at once. To create independent annotations (i.e. where one or another
may apply, but not necessarily all at once), finish the annotation
with one extension (or set of extensions), and then use the
"Copy and edit" feature to create another annotation where you can edit
the extension(s).
</p>

<p>
In all cases, the actual relation name used by the database will
appear when you have finished the annotation plus extensions.
</p>

<p>
When you edit or duplicate an annotation, extensions can also be
added, amended or deleted. An "Edit" button in the pop-up launches the
annotation extension addition steps.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/ext_edit_button.png') %>" alt="button to edit annotation extensions"/>
</div>

<p>
To change an existing extension, first delete it and then add a new
one. Editing interface ("protein mislocalized to nucleus" example):

</div>


<p>
Phenotype annotation extensions can be used to indicate:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
 Penetrance: the proportion of a population that shows the
 phenotype. The penetrance measurement can be qualitative or
 quantitative. The pulldown menu for qualitative options is selected
 by default. For a quantitative value, switch the radio button and
 enter a percentage (e.g. 38%) in the text box.
</li>
<li>
 Expressivity: the extent to which a phenotype is expressed; usually
 used to capture information about phenotype severity. Only
 qualitative values are supported; choose from the pulldown menu.
</li>
<li>
 A specific gene, RNA or protein, used in an assay (see "Targets of
 mutated genes" and "Localization phenotypes" below). The pulldown
 menu is populated with genes from the list you entered for the
 paper. You can add another gene at this point if necessary. For some
 phenotypes, a Sequence Ontology (SO) term can be selected to describe
 a more general sequence region or class of transcripts. In these
 cases, the ontology-search autocomplete box appears, and searches
 SO. Type text, choose from the suggestions, and drill down to more
 specific terms as usual.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
More details on annotation extension options are available in the
"phenotype tips" sections below.
</p>

<h2><a name="gentips">General phenotype tips</a></h2>

<h3>Phenotype vs. GO annotations</h3>
<p>
  GO annotations should always reflect a gene's direct involvement in,
  or role in regulating, processes or functions. In contrast,
  phenotype annotations indicate that a mutation causes a change in a
  process, but may reflect downstream or indirect effects.
</p>
<p>
  For example, cells mutated for a gene involved in cell wall
  biosynthesis may display defects in cytokinesis. This gene should
  not be annotated to the GO process term "cytokinesis" because its
  effect on cytokinesis is an indirect effect of improper cell wall
  biosynthesis, but the mutant allele may be annotated to the FYPO
  term "abnormal cytokinesis".
</p>
<p>
  Most commonly, more phenotypes than GO terms can be extracted from a
  paper. Sometimes, several phenotype annotations but no GO
  annotations can be made, because the experiments do not definitively
  resolve the exact process that the gene is involved in.
</p>


<h3>Phenotype categories</h3>
<p>
Phenotypes may be observed at the level of a cell or its parts
(e.g. "elongated cell", "abnormal cytokinesis", "abnormal microtubule
cytoskeleton morphology"), or at a population level
(e.g. "flocculating cells"). In particular, note that viability can be
described at either the cell or population level, or both (also see
below). Phenotypes affecting binding or enzymatic activities, such as
cases where a mutation decreases enzymatic activity, can also be
annotated. Phenotypes affecting molecular functions will be displayed
with the "cell phenotypes" on PomBase gene pages (even if the activity
was assayed in vitro).

</p>

<h3>Normal phenotypes</h3>
<p>
Often, a mutant will be assayed for a phenotype but will appear
identical to wild-type cells in the assay. One or more of the "normal
phenotype" terms, which are defined as having no observable difference
from wild type under the given conditions, can be used to annotate
these mutants. For example, an allele may be annotated to "normal
growth on amphotericin B" or "normal cell morphology". A mutant may be
"normal" in one respect, but abnormal in another (for instance, cells
may grow at a normal rate, but have an abnormal morphology). Note that
it is not necessary to annotate all respects in which a mutant cell is
normal, only those that are unexpected or otherwise interesting.
</p>

<h3>Targets of mutated genes</h3>
<p>
For any phenotype where an effect on the amount, stability,
localization, etc. of a specific gene or gene product (protein or RNA)
was measured, an extension should be included to identify the genes,
RNAs, or proteins used in the experiment. The reasons are that the
measured product may be that of a gene that was not mutated, and that
the mutation may affect different gene products differently. For
example, deletion of gene A may result in an increased amount of RNA
transcribed from gene B; or a point mutation in A may cause decreased
phosphorylation of protein B but not protein C. In these cases the
annotation should be made to gene A, and an extension should be
included that gene B is affected (and that C is not affected, in the
second example). Sometimes it may be necessary to specify two
targets. For instance, if a mutation in gene A cause "decreased
binding" between protein B and protein C, include both B and C in the
comment.
</p>

<h3>Localization phenotypes</h3>
<p>
If the localization of a protein or RNA is altered in a mutant
compared to wild type, this should be annotated as a phenotype of the
mutated gene (which may be different from the gene encoding the
mislocalized product). Include an extension to identify the
mislocalized protein/RNA, as described above. For example, if deletion
of gene A causes gene B to localize to the cytoplasm instead of the
nucleus, annotate A to an "abnormal protein localization" term (such
as "abolished protein localization to nucleus, with protein
mislocalized to cytoplasm"), and mention B in an extension.
</p>

<h3>Phenotypes of wild-type cells</h3>
<p>
Please note that only <b>mutant</b> phenotypes should be annotated in
Canto -- i.e., the characteristics of cells in which DNA sequence of a
gene is altered, or when its expression level is changed (or
both). Any changes occurring in wild-type cells in response to a
stimulus (such as an effect resulting from the inhibition of a
wild-type gene when it binds a substance) can therefore not be
captured as a phenotype. Please include information of this sort in a
comment, and PomBase curators will advise you how to proceed (for
example, it may be possible to use a GO annotation with an extension).
</p>


<h2><a name="sptips">Specific phenotype tips</a></h2>

<h3>Cell and population viability</h3>

<p>
To capture whether a mutant is viable or inviable overall, use one of
the cell population viability terms. As noted in the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/faqs/can-i-get-list-essential-pombe-genes">PomBase
FAQ on essential genes</a>, the most commonly used terms are "viable
vegetative cell population" (FYPO:0002060) and "inviable vegetative
cell population" (FYPO:0002061).
</p>
<p>
To describe characteristics of viable or inviable cells, FYPO has a
wide selection of "viable cell" and "inviable cell" terms that also
specify other features such as shape, presence and number of nuclei or
septa, etc. If one mutation gives rise to a mixed population, more
than one term may be used for the same allele, including both "viable"
and "inviable" terms, and extensions should be used to indicate
penetrance. See the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/faqs/why-are-some-genes-annotated-both-viable-and-inviable-phenotypes">relevant
FAQ</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Cell growth vs. cell population growth</h3>
<p>
Most experiments that measure "growth" observe a population of
cells, such as a culture in liquid medium or a colony on a
plate. For these experiments, use one or more of the "cell
population growth" terms. In contrast, terms such as "normal cell
growth" refer specifically to growth in the sense of an increase
in cell size. Also see "Slow growth, decreased cell density and
decreased growth" below.
</p>

<h3>Slow growth, decreased cell density and decreased growth</h3>
<p>
"Slow cell population growth" refers specifically to when the rate
of growth (slope) of a cell population is decreased. "Decreased
cell density in stationary phase" refers to when a population
reaches stationary phase at, and maintains, a lower cell density
than wild type (the rate of growth may still be the same as
wild-type). An allele may be annotated to both terms. If you do
not know which of these is decreased (typically if cells are grown
on agar plates for a number of days and then observed) use
"decreased cell population growth".
</p>

<h3>Cellular structures vs. processes affecting cellular structures</h3>
<p>
FYPO includes many pairs of terms that refer to the same cellular or
subcellular structure, where one describes the structure (as normal,
abnormal, etc.) and the other describes a process affecting the
structure. In each pair, the structural phenotype term uses a GO
cellular component (CC) term in its logical definition, and the
process phenotype term uses a GO biological process (BP) term. The
terms will often be linked by a has_output relation. For example,
"abnormal kinetochore morphology" (FYPO:0000050) refers to the GO CC
term "kinetochore" (GO:0000776), and "abnormal kinetochore
organization" (FYPO:0000807) refers to the GO BP term "kinetochore
organization" (GO:0051383).
</p>

<p>
Use the process phenotype term to annotate experiments in which the
assay can monitor the process as it occurs (e.g. if you have movies,
kymographs, a reconstituted system, or even a sufficiently detailed
series of still pictures). Otherwise, use the structure or morphology
phenotype terms (e.g. when you have only one or a few still pictures).
</p>

<h3>Translation vs. protein level</h3>
<p>
  Typically, assays such as western blots do not distinguish between
  increased translation or decreased degradation. If these cannot be
  distinguished between then the correct terms to use are increased,
  decreased, or normal protein level. If the assay is specific enough,
  then the translation or degradation terms may be used
  (e.g. "decreased translation" or "increased protein
  degradation"). In either case, the specific protein(s) assayed can
  be put in annotation extensions.
</p>

<h3>Transcription vs. RNA level</h3>
<p>
  Typically, assays such as northern blots do not distinguish between
  increased transcription or decreased degradation. If these cannot be
  distinguished between then the correct terms to use are increased,
  decreased, or normal RNA level. If the assay is specific enough,
  then the transcription or degradation terms may be used (e.g. a
  run-on assay can support annotation to "decreased
  transcription"). In either case, the specific gene(s) assayed can be
  put in annotation extensions.
</p>
