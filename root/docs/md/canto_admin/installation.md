# Canto installation
## Requirements
- Linux
- Docker (preferred)

## Installing with Docker

The recommended method for installating and running Canto to use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker).

The following commands will install and initialise a Canto instance.
The commands retrieve the Canto code, start a temporary Docker
container and then initialise Canto.

    # this directory can be anywhere and have any name
    mkdir canto-space

    cd canto-space

    mkdir data
    mkdir import_export
    mkdir logs

    git clone https://github.com/pombase/canto.git

    # initialise the data directory 
    ./canto/script/canto_start_docker --initialise /data

At this point the `data` directory is initialised and the
`canto/canto_deploy.yaml`
[Configuration file](canto_admin/configuration_file) has been created
for this Canto instance.

To test that the installation and initialisation succeeded, use this
command to start Canto:

    ./canto/script/canto_start_docker

then go to `http://localhost:5000/` to check that Canto is running.

Use `docker stop canto-container` in another terminal to stop the server.

If that works the next step is to [configure Canto](setup).

## Manual installation on Debian or Ubuntu

If Docker isn't an option for you, it's possible to install and run
Canto on a Debian Linux based system.  The instructions below should
work on both Debian and Ubuntu based systems.

### Software requirements for manual installation

The following software is needed:

- Perl
- Git
- GCC and G++ (for compiling part of the Perl libraries)
- Make
- CLucene v0.9.*
- Module::Install and Module::Install::Catalyst

### Supported systems

Canto should be installable on any system that supports the software requirements.
These instructions have been tested on Debian (v7.0+) and Ubuntu (v12.04+).

### Installing prerequisites on Debian and Ubuntu

On Debian and Ubuntu, the software requirements can be installed using the
package manager:

    sudo apt-get install perl gcc g++ tar gzip bzip2 make git-core wget \
      libmodule-install-perl libcatalyst-devel-perl liblocal-lib-perl \
      libpq-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libexpat1-dev

Optional: to improve the installation speed, these Perl packages can be installed
before proceeding:

    sudo apt-get install libhash-merge-perl \
      libhtml-mason-perl libplack-perl libdbix-class-perl \
      libdbix-class-schema-loader-perl libcatalyst-modules-perl libio-all-lwp-perl \
      libwww-perl libjson-xs-perl libio-all-perl \
      libio-string-perl libmemoize-expirelru-perl libtry-tiny-perl \
      libarchive-zip-perl libtext-csv-xs-perl liblingua-en-inflect-number-perl \
      libcatalyst-modules-perl libmoose-perl libdata-compare-perl \
      libmoosex-role-parameterized-perl libfile-copy-recursive-perl \
      libxml-simple-perl libtext-csv-perl libtest-deep-perl \
      libtext-markdown-perl libchi-driver-memcached-perl libchi-perl \
      libcache-memcached-perl libcache-perl libfile-touch-perl \
      liblwp-protocol-psgi-perl libweb-scraper-perl \
      libdbd-pg-perl libdata-javascript-anon-perl starman libnet-server-perl \
      libautobox-list-util-perl libwant-perl libautobox-core-perl

If these packages aren't installed, the required Perl modules will be installed using
CPAN, which is slower.

[CLucene](http://clucene.sourceforge.net/) is required by Canto. For
Debian version 7 ("wheezy") and earlier and Ubuntu version 13.04 ("Raring")
and earlier it can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install libclucene-dev libclucene0ldbl

### CLucene on Ubuntu v13.10 and later

For these Ubuntu versions the correct version of the CLucene library must be
installed manually.  The Perl CLucene module is currently only compatible with
CLucene version 0.9.* but Ubuntu v13.10 and later ship with CLucene v2.3.3.4.

The required CLucene library can be installed with:

    wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/clucene-core/libclucene0ldbl_0.9.21b-2_amd64.deb
    wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/clucene-core/libclucene-dev_0.9.21b-2_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libclucene0ldbl_0.9.21b-2_amd64.deb libclucene-dev_0.9.21b-2_amd64.deb

You may need to "pin" those version in v14.10.  For example, add a file
called `/etc/apt/preferences.d/clucene-pin` with these contents:

    Package: libclucene0ldbl
    Pin: release a=precise
    Pin-Priority: 999

    Package: libclucene-dev
    Pin: release a=precise
    Pin-Priority: 999

### CLucene on Debian v8 ("Jessie") and later

The CLucene libraries must be manually installed for Debian v8 with:

    wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/clucene-core/libclucene-dev_0.9.21b-2+b1_amd64.deb
    wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/clucene-core/libclucene0ldbl_0.9.21b-2+b1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libclucene0ldbl_0.9.21b-2+b1_amd64.deb libclucene-dev_0.9.21b-2+b1_amd64.deb

### Getting the Canto source code
Currently the easiest way to get the code is via GitHub. Run this command
to get a copy:

    git clone https://github.com/pombase/canto.git

This creates a directory called "`canto`". The directory can be updated
later with the command:

    git pull

### Downloading an archive file

Alternatively, GitHub provides archive files for the current version:

- https://github.com/pombase/canto/archive/master.zip
- https://github.com/pombase/canto/archive/master.tar.gz

Note after unpacking, you'll have a directory called `canto-master`. The text
below assumes `canto` so:

    mv canto-master canto

### CPAN tips
It's best to configure the CPAN client before starting the Canto
installation. Start it with:

    cpan

At this prompt choose 'sudo':

    What approach do you want?  (Choose 'local::lib', 'sudo' or --> 'manual')

When started, cpan will attempt to configure itself. Usually the default
answer at each prompt will work.

Use these commands at the `cpan` prompt avoid lots of questions while
installing modules later.

    o conf prerequisites_policy follow
    o conf build_requires_install_policy no
    o conf commit

Install the `Module::Install::Catalyst` module (at the `cpan` prompt):

    install Module::Install
    install Module::Install::Catalyst

Quit cpan and return to the shell prompt with:

    exit

### Install dependencies
In the `canto` directory:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make installdeps
    make

Answer "yes" to the "Auto-install the X mandatory module(s) from CPAN?"
prompt.

### Run the tests
To check that all prerequisites are installed and that the code Canto tests
pass:

    make test

## Canto in a Virtual machine
Canto can be tested in a virtual machine using
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) and
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/). This combination is available on Linux,
MacOS and Windows.

These instructions have been tested on a 64 bit host.

### Installing VirtualBox

Installation packages for VirtualBox are available here:
  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

On some operating systems, packages may be available from the default
repositories:

* Debian: https://wiki.debian.org/VirtualBox
* Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox
* Red Hat/Centos: http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Virtualization/VirtualBox

### Installing Vagrant

Installation instructions for Vagrant are here:
http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Users of recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu can install with:

    apt-get install vagrant

### Canto via Vagrant

Once VirtualBox and Vagrant are installed, use these commands to create a
virtual machine, install the operating system (Ubuntu) and install Canto and
its dependencies:

    cd canto
    vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
    vagrant up

The `vagrant` command will take many minutes to complete. If everything is
successful, once `vagrant up` returns you can `ssh` to the virtual machine
with:

    vagrant ssh

From that shell, the Canto server can be started with:

    cd canto
    ./script/canto_start

Once started the server can be accessed on port 5500 of the host:
http://localhost:5500/

## Testing the manual installation

To try the Canto server after a non-Docker installation:

### Initialise a test data directory
Make a data directory somewhere:

    mkdir /var/canto-data

From the `canto` directory:

    ./script/canto_start --init /var/canto-data

This will initialise the `canto-data` directory and will create a
configuration file (`canto_deploy.yaml`) in the `canto` directory that can be
customised.

### Run a test server
Again, from the `canto` directory.

    ./script/canto_start

### Visit the application start page
The test application should now be running at http://localhost:5000
