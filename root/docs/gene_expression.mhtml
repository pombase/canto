<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating Gene Expression -->
<!-- FLAGS: use_bootstrap -->

<p>
The RNA level and protein level annotation options allow you to
annotate descriptions that will appear in the "Qualitative gene
expression" section of PomBase gene pages. (Quantitative gene
expression curation will be added to Canto in the future; in the
meantime, data for large gene sets can be <a
href="https://www.pombase.org/submit-data/bulk-annotation">submitted
to PomBase in bulk</a>.)
</p>

<p>
First, select a description from the pull-down menu:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/gene_exp_description.png') %>" alt="Gene expression description selection"/>
</div>

<p>
Select evidence in the next pulldown.
</p>

<p>
Note: The options are fixed for both descriptions and evidence; <a
href=mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org>contact the curators</a> if you think
anything is missing from the options.
</p>


<h4>Annotation extensions</h4>

<p>
You can add annotation extensions to specify when the description of
the level applies. Use "during" to select a GO term for a cell cycle
stage or cellular response. The "in presence of" option lets you
choose a ChEBI term for a chemical substance. For either, type in the
text box and then select one of the autocomplete options.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to make changes to an annotation
you have made, use the "Edit" link next to the annotation in the
table. In the pop-up edit the appropriate fields, then click "OK".
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/edit_gene_expression.png') %>" alt="Gene expression editing pop-up"/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Delete:</strong> The "Delete" link will ask you to confirm
that you want to remove an annotation, and then delete it.
</p>
<p> 
<strong>Copy and edit:</strong> The "Copy and edit" link in the table
on a gene page allows you to make another annotation to the same gene.
The interface works the same way as for editing an annotation, except
that a new annotation is created, and the old annotation is retained
without changes.
</p>

<p>
On the paper summary page, the "Copy and edit" link adds one more feature:
the annotation can be transferred, with or without other changes, to
any other gene in the gene list, by changing the top pulldown.
</p>

<p>
The "quick add" links available in advanced mode open the editing
pop-up without any data entered or selected.
