<h2>General GO annotation</h2>
<p>There are two parts to a GO annotation: first, the association between a gene
product and GO term; and second, the source and evidence used to make the
association.
</p>
<p>
Each GO term represents an activity, process, or location in the cell of a
gene product, and has a name (called the GO Term name), a numerical identifier
(called the GO ID), and a text definition. The first part of the annotation
involves selecting the "GO term" (see choosing the correct GO term)
</p>

<h2>Choosing the correct GO term (general)</h2>
<p>
When using GO terms -- or terms from any ontology -- always pay
careful attention to the term definitions. They are usually more
detailed, and often more informative, than the term names alone. For
each annotation, ensure that the definition of the selected term
accurately describes the experiment you are trying to capture, and
that the results shown in the paper fit all parts of the term
definition.
</p>
<p>
To find a GO term, type text into the search box. When suggestions
from the autocomplete feature appear, choose one and proceed. If your
initial search does not find any suitable terms, try again with a
broader term (some examples are provided in the specific sections
below). Selecting a term takes you to a page where you can read the
definition to confirm that it is applicable. More specific "child"
terms will be shown (where available), and you can select one of these
more specific terms in an iterative process. GO terms are organised in
a hierarchical structure, and GO annotations should be as specific as
possible to describe the data from your experiment. (More information
on <a href="http://geneontology.org/GO.contents.doc.shtml#ontology">GO
organisation</a> is available on the GO web site.)
</p>
<p>
You will have the opportunity to request a new term if the most specific term
available does not describe your gene product adequately.
</p>

<h2>Choosing the Evidence code</h2>
<p>
After selecting a GO term, you must choose the evidence code that best
describes your experiment.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mutation(s) in a single gene: IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype)</li>
  <li>Mutations in more than one gene in the same strain: IGI (inferred from genetic interaction)</li>
  <li>Direct physical interaction of one single gene product with another: IPI (inferred from physical interaction)</li>
  <li>Direct assay of the location, complex, function or process: IDA (inferred from direct assay)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data supporting the evidence</h2>
<p>
"With" field: IGI or IPI evidence requires that you indicate the interacting
gene product. Choose the appropriate gene from the list you initially entered
(or add genes to the list if necessary).
</p>
<p>
See the ontology aspect (cellular component, biological process, molecular
function) specific sections below for more detailed trouble shooting.
</p>


<h2>Editing, deleting and duplicating GO annotations</h2>

<p>
<strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to make changes to an annotation
you have made, use the "Edit" link next to the annotation in the
table. In the pop-up edit the appropriate fields, then click "OK".
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for('/static/images/docs/go_edit.png') %>" alt="GO editing interface"/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Delete:</strong> The "Delete" link will ask you to confirm
that you want to remove an annotation, and then delete it.
</p>
<p> <strong>Duplicate:</strong> The "Duplicate" link in the table on a
gene page allows you to make another annotation to the same gene. For
example, you may want to indicate that genetic interactions with two
different genes both support annotation to the same GO term. The
interface works the same way as for editing an annotation, except that
a new annotation is created, and the old annotation is retained
without changes.
</p>

<p>
On the paper summary page, the "Duplicate" link adds one more feature:
the annotation can be transferred, with or without other changes, to
any other gene in the gene list, by changing the top pulldown:

<h2>Specific branches of GO</h2>
<h3><a name="component"></a>Cellular Component</h3>
<p>
Cellular component describes locations, at the levels of subcellular
structures and macromolecular complexes. Examples of cellular components
include nucleus, nuclear inner membrane, nuclear pore, and proteasome
complex. Generally, a gene product is located in or is a subcomponent of a
particular cellular component. The cellular component ontology includes
multi-subunit enzymes and other protein complexes, but not individual proteins
or nucleic acids.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suggested broad terms to start searching
    <ul>
      <li>rough endoplasmic reticulum</li>
      <li>nucleus</li>
      <li>ribosome</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be careful when interpreting subcellular locations, as certain tagged
    proteins may be mis-targeted. For example, proteins are often mislocalized to
    vacuole or other components upon addition of the tag.</li>
  <li>When a macromolecular complex is characterized, all of the subunits should be
    annotated to an appropriate complex term in the Cellular Component ontology
    (example, GO:0005681, 'spliceosomal complex' or GO:0000786, 'nucleosome').</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="function"></a>Molecular Function</h3>
<p>
A molecular function is an activity, such as a catalytic or binding activity,
that occurs at the molecular level. GO molecular function terms represent
activities that perform the actions (protein serine/threonine kinase activity,
pyruvate carboxylase activity), rather than the entities (gene products or
complexes). As a general rule, molecular functions correspond to single step
activities performed by individual gene products.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suggested broad terms to start searching
    <ul>
      <li>transporter</li>
      <li>transferase activity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a Molecular Function and
Biological Process term.  The key question to ask to establish if you need a
Molecular Function term is whether the results shows how the gene product
accomplishes its role. For example, if the result shows that a mutant version
of a gene product affects transcription, by itself that doesn’t imply that the
gene product is a transcription factor. If the study shows that the gene
product binds to DNA or protein and thereby modulates transcription, then an
appropriate Molecular Function term ('sequence-specific DNA binding RNA
polymerase II transcription factor activity' or 'protein binding transcription
factor activity') can be used. Data from the mutation experiment can be used
to make an annotation to the Biological Process term ‘transcription, DNA
dependent’ or to one of its child terms.
</p>
<p>
Ensure that the experiment supports annotating to the GO term definition. For
example, if a paper states in the introduction that a gene product is a
transcription factor but provides results only showing DNA binding, then this
paper should not be used to annotate to 'sequence-specific DNA binding RNA
polymerase II transcription factor activity'. The appropriate term would be
‘sequence specific DNA binding’ or one of its child terms. In another
situation, if the author states that a protein is a serine/threonine/tyrosine
kinase, but only shows experimental evidence for serine and threonine, the
curator can only annotate to 'protein serine/threonine kinase activity'.
</p>
<p>
Annotating to 'protein binding' (GO:0005515), has to be done with caution as
most proteins within the cell bind to other proteins at one time or another.
Keep in mind is whether the gene product being annotated is accomplishing a
biological purpose by binding to another protein: if so, protein binding is
its function. Only annotate direct protein binding using the GO term "protein
binding".
</p>

<h3><a name="process"></a>Biological Process</h3>
<p>
A biological process is series of events accomplished by one or more ordered
assemblies of molecular functions. It can be difficult to distinguish between
a biological process and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a
process must have more than one distinct step (e.g. cell cycle, transport,
signal transduction).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suggested broad terms to start searching</li>
    <ul>
      <li>cell cycle</li>
      <li>transport</li>
      <li>terms in
      the <a href="http://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms">Biological
      Process GO slim</a> may be useful starting points </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Check that the selected GO term definition matches the specificity of the
experiment. For example, if a paper shows experimental results that a gene
product can transport specific amino acids and the authors extrapolate that
the gene product can transport any amino acid, the gene product should be
annotated only to transport of the amino acid that was shown experimentally.
</p>
<p>
Direct vs. indirect effects: With mutant phenotypes, often it is hard to
discern if a gene product is directly involved in a process or if its absence
has an indirect/downstream effect. For example if any of the proteins involved
in splicing is mutated, it affects translation. This is a downstream effect
because most of the genes encoding ribosomal proteins have introns and if
splicing genes are mutated, these ribosomal genes are not processed, thereby
affecting ribosomal assembly and hence translation.  In this case the genes
involved in splicing shouldn’t be annotated to translation. Instead, you
should make a phenotype annotation to "abnormal translation" or one of its
children.
</p>
<p>
Annotating to "response to stimulus" terms: There are many RNA expression
studies that measure the levels of RNA species when exposed to various stimuli
and then suggest that the genes are over expressed and thus involved in
responding to that stimulus. An increase in expression during a process does
not always imply that the genes are directly involved in that process. The
‘response to’ terms are intended to annotate gene products that are required
for the response to occur (e.g. production of a gene product or hormone, or
initiation of cell division). If nothing else is known about the gene product,
make a phenotype annotation to "increased RNA level" or one of its children
</p>
<p>Annotating to regulation terms: Regulation of a process is defined as any
pathway that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of that process. To
decide if the gene product participates directly in a process or regulates the
process, consider: does the gene product being annotated perform within the
pathway or upstream of the pathway to start or stop or change the rate of the
process? Note that a gene product may be involved *both* directly in a
process, and in its regulation (for example enzymes in a pathway which
regulate the pathway via a feedback loop).
