<h2>General GO annotation</h2>
<p>There are two parts to a GO annotation: first, the association between a gene
product and GO term; and second, the source and evidence used to make the
association.
</p>
<p>
Each GO term represents an activity, process, or location in the cell of a
gene product, and has a name (called the GO term name), a numerical identifier
(called the GO ID), and a text definition. The first part of the annotation
involves selecting GO term (see choosing the correct GO term).
</p>

<h2>Choosing the correct GO term (general)</h2>
<p>
When using GO terms -- or terms from any ontology -- always pay
careful attention to the term definitions. They are usually more
detailed, and often more informative, than the term names alone. For
each annotation, ensure that the definition of the selected term
accurately describes the experiment you are trying to capture, and
that the results shown in the paper fit all parts of the term
definition.
</p>
<p>
To find a GO term, type text into the search box. When suggestions
from the autocomplete feature appear, choose one and proceed. If your
initial search does not find any suitable terms, try again with a
broader term (some examples are provided in the specific sections
below). Selecting a term takes you to a page where you can read the
definition to confirm that it is applicable. More specific "child"
terms will be shown (where available), and you can select one of these
more specific terms in an iterative process. GO terms are organised in
a hierarchical structure, and GO annotations should be as specific as
possible to describe the data from your experiment. (More information
on <a href="http://geneontology.org/GO.contents.doc.shtml#ontology">GO
organisation</a> is available on the GO web site.)
</p>
<p>
See the "Specific branches of GO" sections below for more advice on
choosing terms from each ontology aspect (cellular component,
biological process, molecular function).
</p>

<p>
You will have the opportunity to request a new term if the most specific term
available does not describe your gene product adequately.
</p>

<h2>Choosing the Evidence code</h2>
<p>
After selecting a GO term, you must choose the evidence code that best
describes your experiment.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mutation(s) in a single gene: IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype)</li>
  <li>Mutations in more than one gene in the same strain: IGI (inferred from genetic interaction)</li>
  <li>Direct physical interaction of one single gene product with another: IPI (inferred from physical interaction)</li>
  <li>Direct assay of the location, complex, function or process: IDA (inferred from direct assay)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data supporting the evidence</h2>
<p>
"With" field: IGI or IPI evidence requires that you indicate the interacting
gene product. Choose the appropriate gene from the list you initially entered
(or add genes to the list if necessary).
</p>


<h2>Editing, deleting and duplicating GO annotations</h2>

<p>
<strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to make changes to an annotation
you have made, use the "Edit" link next to the annotation in the
table. In the pop-up edit the appropriate fields, then click "OK".
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for($image_path . '/go_edit.png') %>" alt="GO editing interface"/>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Delete:</strong> The "Delete" link will ask you to confirm
that you want to remove an annotation, and then delete it.
</p>
<p> <strong>Copy and edit:</strong> The "Copy and edit" link in the table on a
gene page allows you to make another annotation to the same gene. For
example, you may want to indicate that genetic interactions with two
different genes both support annotation to the same GO term. The
interface works the same way as for editing an annotation, except that
a new annotation is created, and the old annotation is retained
without changes.
</p>

<p>
On the paper summary page, the "Copy and edit" link adds one more feature:
the annotation can be transferred, with or without other changes, to
any other gene in the gene list, by changing the top pulldown:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for($image_path . '/go_dup_summary.png') %>" alt="GO duplication on summary page"/>
</div>

<p>
The "quick add" links available in advanced mode open the editing pop-up without any data entered or selected.
</p>

<h2>Annotation extensions</h2>

<p>
You can add annotation extensions to provide additional specificity
for GO annotations. (See the <a
href="http://www.pombase.org/documentation/gene-page-gene-ontology">PomBase
documentation</a> (and linked GO documentation) for more information
on annotation extensions.) After you have selected an ontology term
and evidence, the Canto interface will display any available extension
types. Click the link to choose an extension type and bring up a
pop-up in which you specify the required details for the
extension. For example, an annotation to "protein kinase activity" can
have any of these extensions:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for($image_path . '/go_ext_options.png') %>" alt="GO annotation extension options"/>
</div>

<p>
More details on annotation extension options are available in the
sections below on specific branches of GO.
</p>

<p>
If more than one type is offered, you can add one of each type, but if
you add them at the same time they will be interpreted as going
together to form a compound annotation in which all of the parts apply
at once. To create independent annotations (i.e. where one or another
may apply, but not necessarily all at once), finish the annotation
with one extension (or set of extensions), and then use the
"Copy and edit" feature to create another annotation where you can edit
the extension(s).
</p>

<p>
In all cases, the actual relation name used by the database will
appear when you have finished the annotation plus extensions.
</p>

<p>
When you edit or duplicate an annotation, extensions can also be
added, amended or deleted. An "Edit" button in the pop-up launches the
annotation extension addition steps.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="<% $c->uri_for($image_path . '/go_ext_edit_button.png') %>" alt="button to edit annotation extensions"/>
</div>

<p>
To change an existing extension, first delete it and then add a new
one. Editing interface ("protein mislocalized to nucleus" example from
FYPO):

<h2>Specific branches of GO</h2>
<h3><a name="component"></a>Cellular Component</h3>
<p>
Cellular component describes locations, at the levels of subcellular
structures and macromolecular complexes. Examples of cellular components
include nucleus, nuclear inner membrane, nuclear pore, and proteasome
complex. Generally, a gene product is located in or is a subcomponent of a
particular cellular component. The cellular component ontology includes
multi-subunit enzymes and other protein complexes, but not individual proteins
or nucleic acids.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suggested broad terms to start searching
    <ul>
      <li>rough endoplasmic reticulum</li>
      <li>nucleus</li>
      <li>ribosome</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be careful when interpreting subcellular locations, as certain tagged
    proteins may be mis-targeted. For example, proteins are often mislocalized to
    vacuole or other components upon addition of the tag.</li>
  <li>When a macromolecular complex is characterized, all of the subunits should be
    annotated to an appropriate complex term in the Cellular Component ontology
    (example, GO:0005681, 'spliceosomal complex' or GO:0000786, 'nucleosome').</li>
</ul>

<h4>Annotation extensions</h4>
<p>
Any GO cellular component annotation can have extensions indicating
when (i.e. in which cell cycle phase or during which biological
process, usually a response to stress or another stimulus) a gene
product is observed in the given location. For these, type text into
the ontology-search autocomplete box, choose from the suggestions, and
drill down to more specific terms as usual.
</p>

<p>
Annotations to "chromatin" or "chromosomal region" terms may also have
extensions to specify which regions of a chromosome a gene product is
found at. First, use the radio buttons to select a region descriptor
(from the Sequence Ontology (SO)) or a gene. For descriptions, type
text into the ontology-search autocomplete box, choose from the
suggestions, and drill down to more specific terms as usual. Or,
choose a gene from the pulldown menu (you can enter new genes at this
point if necessary).
</p>


<h3><a name="function"></a>Molecular Function</h3>
<p>
A molecular function is an activity, such as a catalytic or binding
activity, that occurs at the molecular level. GO molecular function
terms represent activities (protein serine/threonine kinase activity,
pyruvate carboxylase activity), rather than the entities (gene
products or complexes) that perform the actions. As a general rule,
molecular functions correspond to single step activities performed by
individual gene products.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suggested broad terms to start searching
    <ul>
      <li>transporter</li>
      <li>transferase activity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a Molecular Function and
Biological Process term.  The key question to ask to establish if you need a
Molecular Function term is whether the results shows how the gene product
accomplishes its role. For example, if the result shows that a mutant version
of a gene product affects transcription, by itself that doesnâ€™t imply that the
gene product is a transcription factor. If the study shows that the gene
product binds to DNA or protein and thereby modulates transcription, then an
appropriate Molecular Function term ('sequence-specific DNA binding RNA
polymerase II transcription factor activity' or 'protein binding transcription
factor activity') can be used. Data from the mutation experiment can be used
to make an annotation to the Biological Process term â€˜transcription, DNA
dependentâ€™ or to one of its child terms.
</p>
<p>
Some annotations require careful consideration to ensure that what the
experiment shown truly matches the GO term definition. For example, if
a paper states in the introduction that a gene product is a
transcription factor but provides results only showing DNA binding,
this paper should not be used to annotate to 'sequence-specific
DNA binding RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity'. The
appropriate term would be 'sequence specific DNA binding' or one of
its child terms. In another situation, if the author states that a
protein is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase, but only shows
experimental evidence for serine and threonine, the curator can only
annotate to 'protein serine/threonine kinase activity'.
</p>
<p>
Annotating to 'protein binding' (GO:0005515) has to be done with
caution as most proteins within the cell bind to other proteins at one
time or another.  Keep in mind whether the gene product being
annotated causes a biologically relevant effect by binding to another
protein: if so, protein binding is its function. Only annotate direct
protein binding using the GO term "protein binding".
</p>

<h4>Annotation extensions</h4>
<p>
Annotations to terms representing catalytic activities that act on
protein substrates (e.g. protein kinases or protein transporters) can
have extensions that indicate which substrate(s) were used in your
experiments. Choose a gene from the pulldown menu (you can enter new
genes at this point if necessary).
</p>

<p>
Use "has function during" to specify a cell cycle phase or another
process (usually a response to a stress or another stimulus) in which
the activity is observed. When you select it, the ontology-search
autocomplete box appears. Type text, choose from the suggestions, and
drill down to more specific terms as usual.
</p>

<p>
For DNA binding terms, "binds region" indicates where the annotated
gene product binds. The ontology-search autocomplete box appears, and
searches the Sequence Ontology (SO). Type text, choose from the
suggestions, and drill down to more specific terms as usual.
</p>

<h3><a name="process"></a>Biological Process</h3>
<p>
A biological process is series of events accomplished by one or more ordered
assemblies of molecular functions. It can be difficult to distinguish between
a biological process and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a
process must have more than one distinct step (e.g. cell cycle, transport,
signal transduction).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suggested broad terms to start searching</li>
    <ul>
      <li>cell cycle</li>
      <li>transport</li>
      <li>terms in
      the <a href="http://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms">Biological
      Process GO slim</a> may be useful starting points </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Check that the selected GO term definition matches the specificity of the
experiment. For example, if a paper shows experimental results that a gene
product can transport specific amino acids and the authors extrapolate that
the gene product can transport any amino acid, the gene product should be
annotated only to transport of the amino acid that was shown experimentally.
</p>
<p>
Direct vs. indirect effects: With mutant phenotypes, often it is hard to
discern if a gene product is directly involved in a process or if its absence
has an indirect/downstream effect. For example if any of the proteins involved
in splicing is mutated, it affects translation. This is a downstream effect
because most of the genes encoding ribosomal proteins have introns and if
splicing genes are mutated, these ribosomal genes are not processed, thereby
affecting ribosomal assembly and hence translation.  In this case the genes
involved in splicing shouldnâ€™t be annotated to translation. Instead, you
should make a phenotype annotation to "abnormal translation" or one of its
children.
</p>
<p>
Annotating to "response to stimulus" terms: There are many RNA expression
studies that measure the levels of RNA species when exposed to various stimuli
and then suggest that the genes are over expressed and thus involved in
responding to that stimulus. An increase in expression during a process does
not always imply that the genes are directly involved in that process. The
â€˜response toâ€™ terms are intended to annotate gene products that are required
for the response to occur (e.g. production of a gene product or hormone, or
initiation of cell division). If nothing else is known about the gene product,
make a phenotype annotation to "increased RNA level" or one of its children
</p>
<p>Annotating to regulation terms: Regulation of a process is defined as any
pathway that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of that process. To
decide if the gene product participates directly in a process or regulates the
process, consider: does the gene product being annotated perform within the
pathway or upstream of the pathway to start or stop or change the rate of the
process? Note that a gene product may be involved *both* directly in a
process, and in its regulation (for example enzymes in a pathway which
regulate the pathway via a feedback loop).
</p>

<h4>Annotation extensions</h4>

<p>
Extensions allowed for GO biological process terms fall into a few
broad categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Genes/gene products, such as proteins affected by localization or
 modification processes, or targets of regulatory processes: Choose a
 gene from the pulldown menu (you can enter new genes at this point if
 necessary).
</li>
<li> Locations where a process takes place. Most are regions where
 DNA- or chromatin-based processes occur, and use Sequence Ontology
 (SO) terms, although a few are locations within the cell, using GO
 cellular component terms. For these, type text into the
 ontology-search autocomplete box, choose from the suggestions, and
 drill down to more specific terms as usual.
</li>
<li> A cell cycle phase or other process (usually a response to stress
 or another stimulus) during which the annotated gene product
 participates in the process. For these, type text into the
 ontology-search autocomplete box, choose from the suggestions, and
 drill down to more specific terms as usual.
</li>
</ul>
