Dear <% $curator_known_as // $curator_name %>,

We recently invited you to contribute annotations based on your paper,
<% $publication_uniquename %> -
<% wrap('  ', '  ', '"' . $publication_title . '"') %>,
to <% $config->{database_name} %>.

We have noticed, however, that no action has been taken on the curation
session. Please visit the page linked below, where you can either start
curating the paper, or reassign it to another author (e.g. the first author).

Your curation link is:
  <% $session_link %>

If you are unsure of how to curate this paper, or if you believe that this paper
is not suitable for curation in <% $config->{name} %>, please send a message to
<% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %> for assistance or advice.

To reassign this session, use the "reassign" button, and enter the author's
name and email address. To curate the publication yourself, click "start
curating" and then follow the simple step-by-step instructions to capture the
experimental data reported in your paper.

We greatly appreciate your contribution: all community annotations help keep
<% $config->{database_name} %> literature curation comprehensive, accurate, and
up to date.

<% $session_link %>

Sincerely yours,

% if ($config->{email_signature}) {
<% $config->{email_signature} %>
% } else {
The <% $config->{database_name} %> team
% }
