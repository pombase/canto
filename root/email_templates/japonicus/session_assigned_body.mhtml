Dear <% $curator_known_as // $curator_name %>,

We invite you to contribute annotations based on your recently
published paper, <% $publication_uniquename %> - 
<% wrap('  ', '  ', '"' . $publication_title . '"') %>,
to JaponicusDB. We have identified the paper as suitable for curation in Canto,
but if it reports data for a large number of genes, please let us know so we
can collect the data by a different route.

This is your permanent curation link, where you can sign in, and then
either you can start curating, or assign the session to a colleague
(e.g. a member of your lab):

  <% $session_link %>

% if ($existing_annotation_count > 0) {

For this paper, there are several previously curated annotations in
the database. These existing annotations will be shown in the curation
tool, but cannot be altered. If you notice any problems with existing
annotations, please let the curators know.
% }

Each page in Canto has links to the Canto manual, to specific help
documentation, and to contact the JaponicusDB curators.

We greatly appreciate your contribution. Because JaponicusDB has no
dedicated professional curators, community curation is critical to its
success. If you need help, PomBase curators can add phenotype terms to
FYPO, request new terms from GO, or provide advice about curation.

<% $session_link %>

Sincerely yours,
<% $logged_in_user->name() %>
