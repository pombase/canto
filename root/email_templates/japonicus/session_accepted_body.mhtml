Thank you for agreeing to curate:
  <% $publication_uniquename %>
<% wrap('  ', '  ', '"' . $publication_title . '"') %>

Your curation link is:
  <% $session_link %>

You can annotate these data types in the tool:
  Gene Ontology (molecular function, biological process, cellular component)
  Phenotypes
  Genetic Interactions
  Physical Interactions
  Protein Modifications

If a colleague has asked you to annotate this paper, you will also be
able to modify any annotations your colleague made.

% if ($existing_annotation_count > 0) {
For this paper, there are also several previously curated annotations in the
database.  These existing annotations will be shown in the curation tool, but
cannot be altered. If you notice any problems with existing annotations,
please let the curators know.

% }
Help is available on each page, and you can also read the Canto manual
(<% $help_index %>) or contact the JaponicusDB staff
(<% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %>) for assistance at any time. You
will also have an opportunity to provide any data that the tool does not
capture so that curators can include it with your curation.

The curation link will work indefinitely, so you can leave and return
to the same URL as often as you want. When you have added all the
annotations you can, you may either submit the annotations to the
JaponicusDB volunteers, or send the paper to another co-author for
further curation.

We greatly appreciate your contribution -- all community annotations help keep
JaponicusDB literature curation comprehensive, accurate, and up to date.

Sincerely yours,

Snezhana Oliferenko
