Dear <% $curator_name %>,

<% $reassigner_name %> <<% $reassigner_email %>> has invited you to contribute
annotations to PomBase based on this paper:
  <% $publication_uniquename %>
<% wrap('  ', '  ', '"' . $publication_title . '"') %>

The curation link is:
  <% $session_link %>

When you follow the above link, you will be guided step-by-step though the
process to add more annotations. You can annotate these data types in the
tool:
  Gene Ontology (molecular function, biological process, cellular component)
  Phenotypes
  Genetic Interactions
  Physical Interactions
  Protein Modifications

Existing annotation
You will be able to modify any annotations that your co-author has already
made in this session.

% if ($existing_annotation_count > 0) {
For this paper, there are also several previously curated annotations in the
database.  These existing annotations will be shown in the curation tool, but
cannot be altered. If you notice any problems with existing annotations,
please let the curators know.
% }

Help is available on each page, and you can also read the Canto manual
(<% $help_index %>) or contact the Pom
(<% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %>) for assistance at any time. You
will also have an opportunity to provide any data that the tool does not
capture so that curators can include it with your curation.

The curation link will work indefinitely, so you can leave and return to the
same URL as often as you want. When you have added all the annotations you
can, you may either submit the annotations to the JaponicusDB volunteers, or send
the paper to another co-author for further curation.

We greatly appreciate your contribution -- all community annotations help keep
JaponicusDB literature curation comprehensive, accurate, and up to date.

Because JaponicusDB has no dedicated professional curators, community
curation is critical to its success. If you need help, PomBase
curators can add phenotype terms to FYPO, request new terms from GO,
or provide advice about curation.


<% $session_link %>

Sincerely yours,

Snezhana Oliferenko
