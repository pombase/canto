Dear <% $curator_known_as // $curator_name %>,

We recently invited you to contribute annotations based on your paper,
<% wrap('  ', '  ', '"' . $publication_title . '" (' . $publication_uniquename . '), to JaponicusDB.') %>,

We have noticed, however, that no action has been taken on the curation
session. Please visit this page, where you can either start curating the
paper, or reassign it to another author (e.g. the first author):

  <% $session_link %>

To reassign this session, use the "reassign" button, and enter the author's
name and email address. To curate the publication yourself, click "start
curating" and then follow the simple step-by-step instructions to capture the
experimental data reported in your paper.

If you begin curation, and are then unsure what to do next, or if you believe
that this paper is not suitable for curation in Canto, please send a message
to helpdesk@pombase.org for assistance or advice.

We greatly appreciate your contribution -- all community annotations help keep
JaponicusDB literature curation comprehensive, accurate, and up to date.

Because JaponicusDB has no dedicated professional curators, community
curation is critical to its success. If you need help, PomBase
curators can add phenotype terms to FYPO, request new terms from GO,
or provide advice about curation.


<% $session_link %>

Sincerely yours,
<% $logged_in_user->name() %>
