Some experiments have an inherent directionality. For these experiments, the
curation tool allows you to curate in only one direction once you have
selected the first gene involved in the interaction, as indicated in the
evidence selector. If you have done the experiment in both directions you will
need to switch genes to curate the interaction completely. For "symmetric"
experiment types, you can start with either gene but you only need to curate
the interaction once.
