      It can be difficult to distinguish between a biological process
      and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a process must
      have more than one distinct step.
    suggest_term_help_text: >
      A new term should be differentiated from the parent as a "sub term"  by
      the mechanism of action, or the genes which are required to perform the
      action. It should not be differentiated only by its target gene
      products. For example, histone H2A-S121 phosphorylation
      is a valid term request because it is performed by a set of genes
      specific for this process, translation of histone H2A is not a valid
      term request because there is no translation machinery specifically for
      histone H2A.

      Start typing a description of a condition. If one of the autocomplete
      options matches, click it to add it to the box. If none match, you can type
      out a new description and it will be saved.
      If you tested a set of conditions all at once (e.g. grew cells at high
      temperature and in minimal medium), put the condition descriptions together
      in a single box. For conditions tested one at a time (e.g. separate
      experiments at high and low temperature, or separate cultures with high and
      low glucose levels), list each condition separately.

        If there is any information in your paper which you could not capture in
        the curation tool, please describe the data briefly, as the
        curators may be able to include it in the database.

      <p>
        Examples include:
        <ul>
        <li> protein domain data or other protein sequence features
        <li> missing gene names (synonyms)
        <li> transcriptional regulation (of the wild-type allele - transcriptional changes due to mutations can be captured in Canto)
        <li> complementation data (whether the pombe gene complements a homologue in a different organism or vice versa; complementation may be full, partial or absent)
        <li> gene product name updates
        <li> human or budding yeast orthologs
        </ul>
        Most of these annotation types will be handled in future releases of the
        curation tool.
