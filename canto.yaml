      GO molecular function terms represent activities, rather than
      the things that perform the actions (gene products or

      A biological process is series of events accomplished by one or more
      ordered assemblies of molecular functions.
    more_help_text: >
      It can be difficult to distinguish between a biological process
      and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a process must
      have more than one distinct steps (eg. cell cycle, transport, signal
      transduction).
    suggest_term_help_text: >
      A new term should be differentiated from the parent as a "sub term"  by
      the mechanism of action, or the genes which are required to perform the
      action. It should not be differentiated only by its target gene
      products. For example, histone H2A-S121 phosphorylation
      is a valid term request because it is performed by a set of genes
      specific for this process, translation of histone H2a is not a valid
      term request because there is no translation machinery specifically for
      histone H2a.

        If there is any information in your paper which you could not capture in
        the curation tool, please describe the data briefly, as the
        curators may be able to include it in the database.
      </p>
    extra_text_gene_information: >
      <p>
        Examples include:
        <ul>
        <li> multi-gene phenotypes
        <li> substrates of gene products (e.g. protein substrates of kinases or protein transporters)
        <li> "targets" of localization dependencies (e.g. gene A localizes gene B) 
        <li> cell cycle phases when a process occurs (during)
        <li> specific residues modified in annotated protein modifications (e.g. phosphorylated on residue S45)
        <li> protein domain data or other protein sequence features
        <li> missing gene names (synonyms)
        <li> transcriptional regulation (of the WT allele - transcriptional changes due to mutations can be captured in the tool)
        <li> complementation data (whether the pombe gene complements a homologue in a different organism or vice versa; complementation may be full, partial or absent)
        <li> gene product name updates
        <li> human or budding yeast orthologs
        </ul>
        Most of these annotation-types will be handled in future releases of the
        curation tool.
