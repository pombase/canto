      A molecular function is a catalytic (e.g. protein

      or binding activity, or any other activity that occurs at the
      molecular level.

      GO molecular function terms represent activities, rather than
      the things that perform the actions (gene products or
      complexes). As a general rule, molecular functions correspond to
      single step activities performed by individual gene products.

    help_text: >
      A biological process is series of events accomplished by one or more
      ordered assemblies of molecular functions.
    more_help_text: >
      It can be difficult to distinguish between a biological process
      and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a process must
      have more than one distinct steps (eg. cell cycle, transport, signal
      transduction).
    suggest_term_help_text: >
      A new term should be differentiated from the parent as a "sub term"  by
      the mechanism of action, or the genes which are required to perform the
      action. It should not be differentiated only by its target gene
      products. For example, histone H2A-S121 phosphorylation
      is a valid term request because it is performed by a set of genes
      specific for this process, translation of histone H2a is not a valid
      term request because there is no translation machinery specifically for
      histone H2a.
